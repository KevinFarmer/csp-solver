In order to run the three problems, I included three separate driver class: MapDriver, CircuitBoardDriver and SudokuDriver. Just run them for the three corresponding problems. 

In CircuitBoardDriver, change the boolean simple that is marked to switch between the two examples.

They same goes in SudokuDriver for the boolean easy.
