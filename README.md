## Constraint Satisfaction Problems

This repo contains a solver for a number of constraint-satisfaction problems, such as the map-coloring problem in which no two neighboring territories can be colored the same. The problems and solutions are laid out in detail in CSP-KevinF.pdf.




### To Run

In order to run the three problems, I included three separate driver class: MapDriver, CircuitBoardDriver and SudokuDriver. Just run them for the three corresponding problems. 

In CircuitBoardDriver, change the boolean simple that is marked to switch between the two examples.

They same goes in SudokuDriver for the boolean easy.
